Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Procedural Programming (POP) are two different programming paradigms, each with its own approach to organizing and structuring code. Here are the key differences between OOP and POP:

1. Programming Model:

OOP: In OOP, the focus is on creating and interacting with objects, which represent real-world entities. Objects encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods) related to those entities. OOP promotes the use of classes and objects to model systems.
POP: POP is centered around procedures and functions. It emphasizes writing procedures or functions that perform specific tasks or operations. Data is often treated separately from procedures.
2. Core Concepts:

OOP: OOP revolves around concepts like classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. These concepts allow for modeling complex systems as a collection of interacting objects.
POP: POP focuses on procedures, functions, and structured programming. It promotes breaking down a problem into smaller procedures and using control structures like loops and conditionals.
3. Data Handling:

OOP: In OOP, data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data are encapsulated within objects. Objects can hide their internal state and provide controlled access to their data through methods.
POP: Data is often treated separately from functions. Global variables may be used to store and share data between functions.
4. Reusability:

OOP: OOP promotes code reusability through the concept of inheritance, where classes can inherit properties and behaviors from other classes. This allows for the creation of hierarchies of related classes.
POP: Reusability in POP is achieved by creating functions or procedures that can be called multiple times throughout a program.
5. Abstraction:

OOP: OOP encourages the use of abstraction to simplify complex systems by modeling objects based on essential properties and behaviors. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.
POP: While abstraction can be achieved in POP, it is not as central as in OOP.
6. Message Passing:

OOP: In OOP, objects communicate with each other by sending and receiving messages. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to respond to messages differently.
POP: POP uses function calls to perform tasks, and functions can take arguments as inputs and return values as outputs.
7. Modularity:

OOP: OOP promotes modularity through the encapsulation of data and behavior within objects. Objects can be self-contained and interact with each other through well-defined interfaces.
POP: Modularity in POP is achieved by breaking down a program into smaller, reusable procedures or functions.
8. Real-World Modeling:

OOP: OOP is often used to model real-world entities and their interactions. It is well-suited for applications where objects can be identified and modeled.
POP: POP is more procedural and is often used for tasks that can be expressed as a sequence of steps or procedures.
It's important to note that both OOP and POP have their strengths and are suitable for different types of applications. The choice between them depends on the nature of the problem, the goals of the software, and the programming language being used. In practice, many modern programming languages support both paradigms to varying degrees.
